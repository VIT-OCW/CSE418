Installation Notes:
1.	Install Dev-C++. I installed from the Version 4.9.9.2 Setup File. 
2.	Download graphics.h to the include/ subdirectory of the Dev-C++ directories. 
3.	Download libbgia. to the lib/ In order to use the WinBGIm subdirectory of the Dev-C++ directories. 
4.	Whenever you #include <graphics.h> in a program, you must instruct the linker to link in certain libraries. The command to do so from Dev-C++ is Alt-P. Choose the Parameters tab from the pop-up window and type the following into the Linker area: 
5.	-lbgi
6.	-lgdi32
7.	-lcomdlg32
8.	-luuid
9.	-loleaut32
10.	-lole32
You can now compile and run programs that use the WinBGIm graphics library, such as this one that opens a small window, draws a circle and waits for the user to press a key: 
#include <graphics.h>

int main( )
{
    initwindow(400, 300, "First Sample");
    circle(100, 50, 40);
    while (!kbhit( ))
    {
        delay(200);
    }
    return 0;
}
